# 0x02 Minimum Operations

## Description

The 0x02 Minimum Operations project is a coding challenge that involves finding the minimum number of operations required to convert one string to another using a specific set of operations.

Given two strings, the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. The available operations are:

1. Insertion: Add a character to the string.
2. Deletion: Remove a character from the string.
3. Substitution: Replace one character with another.

The challenge is to write an algorithm or function that efficiently computes the minimum number of operations required.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x02-minimum-operations.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd 0x02-minimum-operations
```

3. Run the code using Python:

```bash
python minimum_operations.py
```

## Usage

The `minimum_operations.py` file contains the implementation of the algorithm to compute the minimum number of operations.

To use the code, modify the `main` function in the `minimum_operations.py` file to provide your desired input strings. Then run the file using the instructions provided in the "Getting Started" section.

The program will output the minimum number of operations required to transform the first string into the second string.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the program:

```python
def main():
    string1 = "kitten"
    string2 = "sitting"

    # Compute the minimum number of operations
    operations = compute_minimum_operations(string1, string2)

    print(f"Minimum number of operations: {operations}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Output:
```
Minimum number of operations: 3
```

In this example, the minimum number of operations required to convert "kitten" into "sitting" is 3.
