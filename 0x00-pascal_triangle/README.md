# Pascal's Triangle

## Introduction
Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical concept that consists of an equilateral triangle of numbers. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it had been previously described in ancient Indian and Chinese mathematics.

## Implementation
I have provided a Python script (`pascal_triangle.py`) that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. The script utilizes a nested list to store the triangle and a simple algorithm to calculate the values.

## Usage
To generate Pascal's Triangle, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `pascal_triangle.py` script from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the command `python pascal_triangle.py`.
5. The script will prompt you to enter the number of rows you want in the triangle.
6. Once you enter the desired number of rows, the script will generate Pascal's Triangle and display it in the terminal.

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the script:

```
$ python pascal_triangle.py
Enter the number of rows for Pascal's Triangle: 6

Pascal's Triangle:
1
1   1
1   2   1
1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1
1   5   10   10   5   1
```

## Further Explorations
Once you have generated Pascal's Triangle, you can explore various interesting properties and patterns associated with it. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Sum the numbers in each row and observe the pattern. What do you notice?
2. Experiment with different row numbers and observe the symmetry of the triangle.
3. Investigate the relationship between Pascal's Triangle and the binomial coefficients.
4. Explore the Fibonacci-like patterns within Pascal's Triangle.
5. Try to derive the mathematical formula for calculating the values in Pascal's Triangle.
