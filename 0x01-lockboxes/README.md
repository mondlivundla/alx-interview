**ES6 Lockboxes**

---

**Overview**

ES6 Lockboxes is a JavaScript library that provides a simple and secure way to store and retrieve data using lockboxes. A lockbox is essentially a container that can hold any type of data and can only be opened with a specific key.

The library is built using ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features and syntax, hence the name. It leverages the powerful features of ES6, such as arrow functions, classes, and modules, to provide an intuitive and efficient API for working with lockboxes.

**Installation**

To use ES6 Lockboxes in your project, you can include the library directly in your HTML file using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="path/to/es6-lockboxes.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, if you are using a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup, you can install ES6 Lockboxes from npm:

```bash
npm install es6-lockboxes
```

And then import it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import Lockboxes from 'es6-lockboxes';
```

**Usage**

ES6 Lockboxes provides a simple API to create, open, and manipulate lockboxes. Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

```javascript
// Create a lockbox
const lockbox = new Lockboxes.Lockbox();

// Add data to the lockbox
lockbox.addData('key1', 'value1');
lockbox.addData('key2', { name: 'John', age: 25 });

// Get data from the lockbox
const data1 = lockbox.getData('key1');
const data2 = lockbox.getData('key2');

console.log(data1); // Output: value1
console.log(data2); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 25 }
```

In this example, we create a new lockbox using the `Lockbox` class constructor. We then add data to the lockbox using the `addData` method, specifying a key and a corresponding value. Finally, we retrieve the data from the lockbox using the `getData` method, passing the key as an argument.

Lockboxes can store any type of data, including strings, numbers, objects, and arrays. The library automatically serializes and deserializes the data as needed, so you don't have to worry about converting data types manually.

**Security**

ES6 Lockboxes focuses on providing a secure way to store and retrieve data. The lockbox and its data are stored in memory and are inaccessible from outside the library. The lockbox can only be opened using the key that was used to create it.

It's important to note that ES6 Lockboxes is a client-side library and does not provide encryption or server-side security. If you require stronger security, it's recommended to encrypt the data before storing it or use server-side encryption.

**API Reference**

ES6 Lockboxes exposes the following methods:

- `addData(key, value)`: Adds data to the lockbox with the specified key.
- `getData(key)`: Retrieves the data from the lockbox with the specified key.
- `removeData(key)`: Removes the data from the lockbox with the specified key.
- `clear()`: Clears all data from the lockbox.
- `hasData(key)`: Checks if the lockbox contains data with the specified key.
- `getAllData()`: Retrieves all data stored in the lockbox as an object.

For detailed information about each method and its usage, please refer to the library's documentation.

**Conclusion**

ES6 Lockboxes is a simple and secure JavaScript library that allows you to store and retrieve data using lockboxes. It leverages the features of ECMAScript 6 to provide an

 intuitive API for working with lockboxes. Whether you need to store sensitive data or just want a convenient way to manage your data, ES6 Lockboxes can be a valuable addition to your JavaScript toolkit.
