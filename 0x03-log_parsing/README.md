- **Customizable Parsing Rules:** Users can define custom parsing rules using regular expressions to handle log files with non-standard formats. This feature provides adaptability to parse logs from custom-built applications or legacy systems.

- **Query and Filtering:** The tool offers powerful query and filtering capabilities, allowing users to search for specific log entries based on criteria such as timestamps, log levels, error codes, or custom-defined keywords.

- **Aggregation and Statistics:** 0x03-log_parsing can perform aggregation and statistical analysis on log data. Users can obtain summaries, counts, or calculate various metrics, aiding in performance monitoring and issue detection.

- **Real-time Parsing and Streaming Support:** For streaming logs or real-time monitoring, the tool supports continuous log parsing, ensuring that new log entries are processed as they arrive.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow these steps to install 0x03-log_parsing:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x03-log_parsing.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x03-log_parsing`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

To start parsing log files with 0x03-log_parsing, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your log file(s) in the supported format (plain text, JSON, XML, or CSV).

2. Run the parsing script with the following command:
   ```
   python log_parser.py /path/to/your/logfile.log
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/logfile.log` with the actual path to your log file.

3. Customize parsing rules (if necessary) in the `config.py` file. Regular expressions can be defined here to handle custom log formats.

4. Utilize the query and filtering capabilities of the tool using command-line options or by integrating the tool with your preferred programming language.

5. Explore the extracted data, perform aggregations, and generate insights from the parsed log data.

## Examples

### Basic Log Parsing

Parse a sample log file and extract relevant fields:

```bash
python log_parser.py sample.log
```

### Customized Parsing

Suppose you have a log file with a custom format. Define parsing rules in `config.py` to extract specific information:

```python
# config.py
CUSTOM_LOG_FORMAT_REGEX = r'^\[(?P<timestamp>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})\] \[(?P<log_level>\w+)\] (?P<message>.+)$'
```

### Querying and Filtering

Filter log entries based on timestamps and log levels:

```bash
python log_parser.py sample.log --start-time "2023-07-01 00:00:00" --end-time "2023-07-05 23:59:59" --log-level "ERROR"
```

### Aggregation and Statistics

Calculate the count of log entries per log level:

```bash
python log_parser.py sample.log --aggregate log_level
```
